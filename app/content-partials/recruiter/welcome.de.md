We spent months talking to people, doing research and learning how people can have real impact against the climate crisis: Our **Crisis Recruiter** makes this knowledge available to you. It's free, open source and only takes a few minutes.

## How Crisis Recruiter works

* We collected {{numberOfInitiatives}} initiatives, groups of people fighting the crisis (e.g. NGOs).
* We matched these initiatives against {{numberOfTags}} properties.
* That data lets us give you useful recommendations, just like in a real conversation.
* To identify the most impactful initiatives, we rely on a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. They identified key areas where your effort has the highest impact on stopping the crisis.
* For the curious, we put an article together on [how we recommend](/what-else/how-we-recommend).
