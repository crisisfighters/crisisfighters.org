Climate change poses an unprecedented threat to companies’ operations, value chains, employees and communities. The economic costs of climate change – from damage to facilities, disrupted operations and supply chains and lost productivity – are already in the hundreds of millions of dollars and expected to reach trillions. While voluntary actions to reduce emissions are important, only public policy can deliver reductions at the speed and scale needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.

*That’s why climate policy advocacy is an essential element of corporate sustainability leadership.*

**As a company, your political influence is a critical tool in the fight against climate change**.
