Today’s debate focuses solely on how hot it will be in 2100. With our current policies we’re most likely to hit 4C, (In 2015, [leading scientists said there’s a 10% chance to end up at 6C](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/global-warming-experts-say-temperatures-could-rise-by-6c-by-2100-with-cataclysmic-results-10193506.html). Emissions kept rising since). What’s not being looked at is that without bringing a halt to emissions soon, temperatures will continue rising afterwards. There’s little point in having an earth that by 2100 at least a few billion people can still inhabit if it becomes uninhabitable a century later.
