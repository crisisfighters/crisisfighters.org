# Why Societies Fail at Reacting to Threats

This article is a crowd-sourced collection of reasons why societies fail at reacting to threats and the best antidotes we could find. Its structure and a significant portion of its content is taken from the amazing book *Collapse - How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive* by Jared Diamond. Go buy or rent it, it's a [Must Read](must-read/#must-read-books)!

**🏗 Work in Progress** Let's research and think deeply to fill this table by [contributing](/contribute)!

# Failure to anticipate problems

#### Changes in supply or demand for goods

</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Lack of knowledge about impact of actions
There is no widespread knowledge about important mechanisms:
* Erosion (from deforestation)
* Soil degradation (from overfarming, lowering water table, killing of sustaining vegetation)
* Salinization (from drought, lowering water table, rising water table, underground salty streams)
* Vicious circles (e.g. heating ↺ land ice melting)
* Tipping points, often triggering vicious cycles (gulf stream reversal, thawing perma frost)

</td>

<tr>
<td>

#### Inability to learn from the past
After the oil crisis, demand of cars plummeted. After a few years, it bounced back and cars got even bigger (e.g. SUVs).

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### False analogy
* Many confuse empirical scientists' warnings of the climate crisis with medieval doomsayers or artists with fin-de-siecle desperation
* On European soils, clearing forests results in sustainable farm land. During colonialism, the practice was exported, resulting in rapid errosion because soils are much less heavy in clay.

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Incompatible Core Values
* Belief in (historic) determinism - “our actions and how we plan for the future don’t affect what will come to be”

</td>
<td>

* The French-German and European integrations overcame long-lasting nationalism to avoid another war.
* The inhabitants of Tikopia island survived because they killed off all pigs to protect the vegetation although pigs were highly valued.
* The Tokugawa shoguns enacted drastic forest protection policies before deforestation became irreversible.
* Joaquin Balaguer, a horrible dictator of the Dominican Republic, enacted costly and far-reaching environmental protection measures despite the political cost.
* Costa Rica abandoned its army and invests heavily in protecting its environment.

# Failure to perceive present problems

#### Imperceptibility
* Nutrients play a major role for farming and water quality but they're invisible for the eye.
* When colonized by Europeans, the Australian environment looked as healthy and resilient as Europe's. It was invisible that flora and fauna are incredibly slow-growing because of the low nutrient levels, damage quickly became irreversible.
* Many soils are low-nutrient, the vegetation contains all the nutrients. Cutting it off quickly damages the soils irreperably.
* In some areas, there are large quantities of salt deep in the ground. It becomes a problem when farming meddles with the water table (e.g. Montana, Australia)
* Miners initially couldn't know that mine runoff elements are toxic.
* Distant managers have a hard time perceiving local problems if they can't easily relate.
* “Creeping Normalcy”, changes are so slow or hidden behind fluctuations that they become imperceptible. Unnoticed, people’s baselines shift with these invisible changes.

# Failure to try to solve it - rational arguments

<table>
<tr>
    <th style="width: 50%">Behavior / Problem</th> <th style="width: 50%">Solutions and Examples</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### Obviously selfish behavior
* Using privileged access to deplete shared resources (e.g. upriver farmers extracting too much water).
* Exploiting natural resources.
* Shifting cleanup costs for operations to society (mining, nuclear, farming).

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Imbalance between big, certain, individual profits and losses spread among many of individuals
For each individual there’s little motivation to fight that specific perpetrator because the damage is so small. Examples:
* Subsidized (direct or indirect, e.g. irrigation, environmental and economic fallout, …) fishery
* Sugar-growing in the US
* Cotton-growing in Australia.

These industries tend to lobby tenaciously for subsidies that represent a huge part of their profits while the losers (all taxpayers) are less vocal because the subsidies are only a small fraction of a country’s total expenses.

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Imbalance between big, certain, immediate profits and losses spread over a long time
* International logging companies move from country to country and typically have short-term leases. They don’t care about the long-time sustainability of their operations

</td>
<td>

* Long-term ownership over limited resources boosts sense of ownership and accountability

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### The Tragedy of the Commons
In the absence of strong regulation, every consumer of a shared resource (fish, water, ore, …) has an interest in using up as much of it as possible to avoid competitors from doing so. This is a classic vicious circle

</td>
<td>🏗

* Regulation and policing
* Privatization boosts ownership and accountability
* Changed consumer behavior
  * Consumers must form a homogenous group
  * They trust and communicate with each other
  * They expect to share a common future and to pass on resources to their heirs
  * They’re capable of organizing and policing themselves
  * The boundaries of the shared resource and its pool of consumers are well-defined
 * Essentially disabling the “It’s someone else’s problem” response

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Exploitative elites
* The more separate elites are from the population (living, transportation, consumption, media), the more rational it becomes for the elites to exploit the general population without harming themselves or their friends.
* Throughout history, actions or inactions by self-absorbed kings, chiefs, and politicians have been a regular cause of societal collapses. Chief among the forces affecting political folly is lust for power, named by Tacitus as ‘the most flagrant of all passions’ (Barbara Tuchman, The March of Folly).

If elites cannot insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions, they act much more in the common interest

# Failure to try to solve it - irrational arguments

<table>
<tr>
    <th style="width: 50%">Behavior / Problem</th> <th style="width: 50%">Solutions and Examples</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### Sticking to cultural/religious beliefs that make adaptation harder
* Harmful industries are often (past) pillars of a society and its cultural identity and still perceived as such.
* Their contributions frequently constitute important cultural/individual achievements to be protected (e.g. using private transportation, owning multiple cars, an array of home appliances, eating meat).
* Conservatives tend to maintain the status quo, even in cases where it contains the seed for its own destruction.

</td>
<td>

* It’s difficult to find out what core values to replace with what.
* Countries replace some core values all the time:
  * The Japanese Army in Japan
  * Legal racism in Europe and the US
  * Communism in Russia
  * Subordination of women
  * Legalized homophobia in most countries

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Public dislike for the (initial) messenger

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Dismissing warnings because of previous false alarms

It's a natural instinct when making sense of the world. It feels rational.

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Clash of short-term and long-term interests
* Every day, millions of desperately poor are forced to undermine their own long-term prospects of betterment to survive and keep their families alive.
* Governments overly focus on problems that are on the verge of explosion.

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Groupthink
* People adjust their thinking and actions to groups they belong to.
* Trying to reach a decision under stressful, high-stakes circumstances may lead to the suppression of doubts and critical thinking, sharing of illusions, a premature consensus, and ultimately a disastrous decision.
* Crowd psychology and groupthink may operate over periods of hours to years.

</td>
<td>🏗 (note: This has the same effect as group inertia. It can also be utilized)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Psychological denial and confirmation bias
* Things arousing painful emotions are sometimes subconsciously or consciously suppressed, even if avoidance turns out to be ultimately disastrous.
* Denial is a way of maintaining psychological sanity in the face of dangers.
* Confirmation bias reinforces that denial as new information confirming previous beliefs are given preference. Over time, irrational and dangerous beliefs solidify.

# Failure to solve it

<table>
<tr>
    <th style="width: 50%">Behavior / Problem</th> <th style="width: 50%">Solutions and Examples</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### The problem is beyond our current capabilities to solve it

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### A solution exists but is prohibitively expensive
We could decarbonize our economy within a few years but colelctively we're not willing to pay the price.

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Too little

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Too late

* Choosing between multiple courses of action sometimes takes so much time that all of them become unfeasible.
* Political decisions take time.
* Example: Florida’s Dusky Seaside Sparrow died out, although the US Fish and Wildlife Service bought the last habitat in the late 1980s at a high price. It was already degraded and deciding whether to breed sparrows in captivity or mixing with the closely related Dusky Seaside Sparrows and then back-crossing the hybrids took so much time that all Sparrows had died out.


</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### A solution backfires and makes the problem worse
* Lack of understanding of interdependencies and complexities easily lead to oversimplified solutions.
* Attempts at (geo-)engineering environmental threats often devastatingly failed in the past. Examples:
  * Introducing the cane toad to Australia to control insect pests resulted in a much worse cane toad pest
  * Forest fire suppression can strengthen vegetation prone to burn and lead to much more devastating fires in the long term.

</td>
<td>🏗</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

#### Lack of Diversity / Putting all one's eggs into one basket
Failure to survive environmental threats is a common outcome for beings, groups, societies and species. Diversity is what enabled nature and human societies to not only survive a changing environment but also gradually increase complexity.
* For example, thanks to its high genetic diversity, the killfish is able to survive extreme levels of toxicity and even survive within oil spills.
* Historically human civilization consisted of thousands of largely independent societies, resulting in natural selection of coping strategies towards any conceivable threat.
* Merging all these societies into one global civilization reduces our ability to react in a distributed, independent manner and basically means that both failure and success are global.
