Searching the internet for climate events and conferences yields quite some results. We looked at them to save you some research. Below we collected why we discourage attending some of the conferences that are out there.

#### February 27: [International Conference on Climate Change](https://climatechangeconferences.com/) (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)
* This conference has only seven speakers. They seem to have academic backgrounds. We're not sure if this conference is relevant.

#### May 7: [International Conference on Climate Change](https://climateconference.heartland.org) (Las Vegas, USA)
* This is a most likely fossil industry funded (organized by the Heartland Institute) conference for climate deniers where paid scientist propagate lies.
* The right-wing Heartland Institute influences governments and society in the US and Europe. Years ago it fought hard to divert public attention from the dangers of smoking and keep big tobacco in business.

#### September 10: [International Conference on Global Warming & Climate Change](https://climatechangeconference.co/) (Bangkok, Thailand)
* Organized by TRIOGM (Sri Lanka) together with the University of Chittagong, Bangladesh and the University of Agriculture Peshawar Pakistan.
* As of February '20 the scientific commitee has only one member. The website overall doesn't look like this is a key conference.

#### [World Conference on Climate Change](https://climatechange.insightconferences.com) (Zurich, Switzerland)
* There's no information about speakers, organized by a company organizing more than 3000 events, including more than 1000 conferences.
* Reason enough for us to question its political and scientific relevance.

#### [World Summit on Climate Change and Global Warming](https://climate.euroscicon.com) (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
* There are no speakers with strong scientific credentials, organized by a company organizing dozens of unrelated conferences. 
* Reason enough for us to question its political and scientific relevance.

#### [Various conferences organized by waset.org](https://waset.org/climate-change-conferences)
* The website contains auto-generated, exactly identical pages for every single of these conferences. There are submissions for each one but the question remains how much they're about improving CVs as opposed to presenting genuine science.
* If you know more, please share, we might be wrong.
