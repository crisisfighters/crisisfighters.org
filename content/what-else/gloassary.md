There are so many terms in and around the fight against the climate crisis that we decided to collect and explain them.
There is an good [glossary by the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-11833685) but it doesn't seem to have been updated since 2014.

| Term                  | Explanation           |
| --------------------- |-----------------------|
| 1.5C                  | Globally agreed-upon (in the *Paris Agreement*) goal to limit global heating to 1.5C (centigrade) as compared to pre-industrial levels. As of 2020 we're already beyond 1.1C heating. |
| [Biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity)          | The variety and variability of life on Earth. A measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Loss of biodiversity makes ecosystems more likely to catastrophically fail when put under stress. |
| [AFOLU](http://www.fao.org/in-action/micca/knowledge/emission/en/)                 | The *Agriculture, Forestry Other Land Use* sector |
| [CO2e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent)                  | To assess warming impact of different Greenhouse Gases in a single number, they can be converted, for example Methane has 34x the impact of CO2 over a time of 100 years. Nitrous Oxide is 298 timess more powerful than CO2. |
| COP / COP25, ...      | Usually refers to the yearly climate conferences organized by *UNFCCC*. In general a *Conference of the Parties* is the governing body of an international convention. |

| [Deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation)         | The removal of a forest from land. Results in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, aridity, extinction, changes to climatic conditions, desertification, and displacement of populations. |
| Disclosure | Refers to companies creating *GHG Inventories* and disclosing their inventory to investors as part of their regular reporting. Increasingly requested by investors, especially pension and souveraign wealth funds to *Divest* and reallocate money based on climate risk and impact. |
| Divestment | |
| [ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental%2C_social_and_corporate_governance) | *Environmental, Social, and Governance* refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.

| [FOLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use,_land-use_change,_and_forestry)                  | Stands for *Forestry and other land use*. Also referred to as *Land use, land-use change, and forestry* (*LULUCF*).|
| [GHG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas)                   | *Greenhouse Gas*, causes the *Greenhouse Effect*. They include CO2, Methane, Nitrous Oxide and Ozone |
| [Greenhouse Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect) | The process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface. |
| GHG Inventory | Detailed information on an entity's emissions and removals of *Greenhouse Gases*. For example by a country, city or company. |
| [INDC / NDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intended_nationally_determined_contributions)            | Intended nationally determined contributions under the *UNFCCC* |

| LULUCF                | *[Land use, land-use change, and forestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use,_land-use_change,_and_forestry)*, also refered to as Forestry and other land use (*FOLU*) |
