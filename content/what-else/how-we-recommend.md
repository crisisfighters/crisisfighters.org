# How We Create Our Recommendations

Our mission is to help you have the biggest impact on the climate crisis. To do that we recommend you the best initiatives. Let us explain what that means.


## What initiatives do we select?
For us an initiative is a group of people that try the best they can to mitigate the climate crisis in accordance with the latest science. We don't consider for-profit companies (but of course many of the initiatives listed successfully help companies to reduce their carbon footprint).

# Background

### Effort-to-Impact Ratio
The methods people employ to tackle the climate crisis range from occupying plants to consulting corporations to become more sustainable. A similar diversity exists in industries and areas, for example energy efficient housing, tree planting and public pressure through creative forms of protest.
We need the whole variety of methods and areas. They depend on and support each other. For example public pressure from civil disobedience shifts mainstream values and influences decisions by company executives. That in turn influences public opinion.

What if there were ways of identifying which initiatives have the biggest impact on saving the climate with the smallest effort?
Of course we could wait - time will tell what worked and what didn’t.

That’s not satisfactory for one the most relevant open questions for the climate movement.
Luckily, some smart people are on it.

### Science to the Rescue
Shouldn’t all our action be guided by identifying the most efficient levers? The [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact](https://www.pik-potsdam.de) recently published the study [Social Tipping Points for Stabilizing Earth’s Climate before 2050](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/5/2354#T2). It is the first attempt at identifying areas where - within a few years - we can get to self-reinforcing developments that exponentially increase the impact of whatever effort we put in before. One example is to push solar and wind energy to the point that due to economies of scale they’re cheaper than fossil fuels for average use cases.
The authors state that more research in the field is needed but the areas identified by the institute are a good starting point to select what areas to put your effort in.

### Data-driven Impact assessment

Now, that science allows us to suggest to you initiatives that work specifically in these larger areas. How can we tell, for each area, which initiatives turn your efforts into the biggest impact?
There are a few indicators: We assume initiatives that energy on validating their own efficiency in a data-driven way be more impactful. After all build-test-measure-adapt is the accepted standard way of doing most kinds of business. A good example is the commitment to the highest possible efficiency in the mission statement of Sandbag, a London- and Brussels-based NGO and thinktank.

# How CrisisFighters.org does it
1. We identify the key areas in which initiatives should be active to have the highest impact on stopping the climate crisis
  1. Our basis is PIK’s study.
  2. We add an area that is mentioned in the study: Initiatives and entities that, like PIK, work on challenging and revalidating what areas are important.
2. Time is running short. We want to reward initiatives that have momentum. Literature TODO LINK shows the importance of momentum on any social movement.
3. While PIKs study doesn’t give an order for these factors, we explain why and how we order them in the table below:
