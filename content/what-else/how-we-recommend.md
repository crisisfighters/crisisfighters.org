# How We Recommend

We help you have the biggest impact on the climate crisis by making meaningful suggestions and showing you the best initiatives.

## What we mean by "initiative"

For us an initiative is a group of people that try the best they can to mitigate the climate crisis in accordance with the latest science. We don't consider for-profit companies (but of course many of the initiatives listed successfully help companies to reduce their carbon footprint).

## How we categorize intitiatives

To make the best possible recommendations we came up with almost a hundred attributes that can be applied to an initiative. We manually research initiatives and assign these attributes. Follow our [Contribute Guide](/contribute) to access all of them.

## How we build our result pages

The results we show you reflect what we would suggest you in person in a conversation. They cover the most important suggestions from joining or financing initiatives to starting your own and convincing your company to decarbonize.

# How we Order Initiatives

### Effort-to-Impact Ratio

The methods people employ to tackle the climate crisis range from occupying plants to consulting corporations to become more sustainable. A similar diversity exists in industries and areas, for example energy efficient housing, tree planting and public pressure through creative forms of protest.
We need the whole variety of methods and areas. They depend on and support each other. For example public pressure from civil disobedience shifts mainstream values and influences decisions by company executives. That in turn influences public opinion.

What if there were ways of identifying which initiatives have the biggest impact on saving the climate with the smallest effort?
Of course we could wait - time will tell what worked and what didn’t.

That’s not satisfactory for one the most relevant open questions for the climate movement.
Luckily, some smart people are on it.

### Science to the Rescue

Shouldn’t all our action be guided by identifying the most efficient levers? The [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de) recently published the study [Social Tipping Points for Stabilizing Earth’s Climate before 2050](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/5/2354#T2). It is the first attempt at identifying areas where - within a few years - we can get to self-reinforcing developments that exponentially increase the impact of whatever effort we put in before. One example is to push solar and wind energy to the point that due to economies of scale they’re cheaper than fossil fuels for average use cases.
The authors state that more research in the field is needed and identified these areas:

* **Energy Production and Storage**, e.g. decarbonizing production and grids
* **Cities and Housing**, e.g. energy-efficient housing, carbon-neutral traffic, construction and industry
* **Finance and Subsidies**, e.g. divesting from fossil fuels, carbon taxation, subsidies for reforestation
* **New Norms and Values**, e.g. awareness sustainable economies and the dangers of greenhouse gases
* **Transforming Education**, e.g. making the latest science available to schools, universities and adults.
* **Transparency and Information Feedbacks**, e.g. labeling products based on climate impact, revealing political influence of the fossil industry

In our recommendations to you we therefore push initiatives up that are strong in one or more of these areas.
