# flyGood.io
> A mobile web app that allows offsetting flights and tipping initiatives

[Climate Stewards](https://www.climatestewards.org/offset) and [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/impact-quantification/gold-standard-global-goals) do an excellent job at providing a scrutinized, transparent way of setting of the emissions generated by each flight. This project aims at providing an easier-to-use website to channel money to them while also allowing to "tip" organizations that actively fight to stop the climate crisis.

flyGood.io will be a mobile webapp that allows users of modern smartphones to pay for tree planting initiatives that offset their flights’ CO2e emissions.

* It uses the web payments API to allow payments in 3 clicks (no credit card data needs to be entered).
* Should provide a MyTaxi/FreeNow like interface to send a 10%, 15% or 20% tip to Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion (more initiatives to follow).
* Can be used by Fridays for Future activists on airports to give out buttons to travellers using it (turning flight shaming into something constructive).

### You can make this happen by helping with the design, implementation, Stripe or setting up a legal entity
* Technical implementation is trivial
* It’s not clear yet whether this requires a lot of book-keeping or if it can be set up without a legal entity. Please reach out if you know more!

# Platform to let startup professionals help NGOs
* Most NGOs have big needs when it comes to collecting, storing and analyzing data, project management, software engineering.
* A small organization could match up NGOs and professionals in startups. This can work bottom-up by asking people to invest their private time and top-down with senior management (e.g. companies providing office space outside work hours to employees to help NGOs or (voluntarily) allocating work time to helping NGOs).

# Monthly Crisis Mitigation Meetups in Hamburg and Berlin, Germany
> Meeting monthly to share the latest science and discuss strategy
The idea is to give updated overviews on global initiatives that try to change the political mainstream and influence governments. In addition to that an open discussion on how to stop the crisis could be held.

# A Global Festival on Fighting the Climate Crisis
> What strategies work in which country? How can we connect activists worldwide?
There is no global conference on mitigating the climate crisis that's open to the paying public. The UN organizes very important conferences organized by governments but there is no place for NGOs and activists to exchange strategies and most importantly to network and collaborate on a global scale.

# Find out What the temperatures will be like in 2200 and 2300
Today’s debate focuses on how hot it will be in 2100. With our current policies we’re most likely to hit 4C, (In 2015, [leading scientists said there’s a 10% chance to end up at 6C](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/global-warming-experts-say-temperatures-could-rise-by-6c-by-2100-with-cataclysmic-results-10193506.html). Emissions kept rising since). What’s not being looked at is that without bringing a halt to emissions soon, temperatures will continue rising afterwards. There’s little point in having an earth that by 2100 at least a few billion people can still inhabit if it becomes uninhabitable a century later.
