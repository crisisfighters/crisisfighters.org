# How we might stop the Climate Crisis
Calls to change individual behavior distract from what's necessary. Our planet will become largely uninhabitable unless we quickly move the political mainstream to enforcing immediate, impactful action. Assessing the efficiency of existing and new initiatives in a crowd-sourced, data-driven way allows to efficiently funnel resources (time & money) to give us a fighting chance._

See [this story on Medium](https://medium.com/@alexthiel/stop-climate-crisis-65239105cf93).

### Context: The Scientific Consensus
* We caused the climate crisis and heated our planet up by 1.1°C.
* The heating rate (currently 0.02°C/year) still rises.
* We're eradicating vital ecosystems like insects and corals.
* Without fast radical change, we irreversibly lose our civilization's livelihood.

### We're at a crossroads
1. We swiftly & drastically cut emissions to buy time to transition our economy. It leaves us ~3 years for radical action but it's possible.
2. We let the problem grow too big to solve. At today's emission rate we'd either have to go to zero emissions in 2027 or leave an uninhabitable earth for our children.

## What options do we have?
### Changing consumption feels good. It's no replacement for action.
In 2015, only [40% of adults heard of climate change](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/analysis-of-a-119-country-survey-predicts-global-climate-change-awareness/). Of these, only a fraction understands how bad the climate crisis is. In that small group, not everybody is sufficiently privileged to engage. **If you're reading this, you're might be on one of these few.**

The internet tells you that what you can do against climate change revolves around vegetarianism, flying less, buying organic and generally less consumption. That's all great, but even if a few million people change their consumption in the next 10 years, we will lose.

Even if everybody who has the economic freedom to do so, goes to zero emissions, it won't solve the problem.

Let's look at the most important options:

1. **Technology.** Not fast enough unless pushed politically. Even fast-spreading technologies strongly appealing to individuals (e.g. mobile phones) take decades to disseminate. It's fair to assume that climate technology comes too late unless pushed politically.
2. **Voluntary Change of Individual Behavior.** Not working without social pressure and political enforcement. I can't think of a way to make billions of humans change their ways within 1–5 years.
3. **Market Forces.** Today's situation is proof that this doesn't work. Lack of regulation allowed profit-oriented companies to neglect their environmental impact for centuries. Books are filled with examples. To name a tiny fraction: the [Amazon's deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_of_the_Amazon_rainforest), planes are still allowed to fly without compensating for emissions, the [palm oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil), [industrial agriculture](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/hidden-costs-industrial-agriculture), [terrible](https://www.bbc.com/news/10313107) [oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill) [spills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill)).
4. **Policy & Regulation.** Rapidly moving a fossil-based economy to renewables and penalizing climate-affecting behavior is possible. [Policies](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes) and [ideas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2019/01/02/feature/opinion-here-are-11-climate-change-policies-to-fight-for-in-2019/) exist but [implementation lacks very far behind](https://climateactiontracker.org/). The challenge is to that public opinion is not sufficiently demanding it

The only feasible option is Policy & Regulation. But how do we get governments and organizations to act? Even repressive regimes react to public opinion: **Large-scale public pressure works**.

## Let's focus on impacting policy. What else is needed?
Looking into the fight against the climate crisis, a few challenges occur. Let me briefly present them alongside solutions.

### Challenge 1: Lack of Understanding
We have [three decades](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229) of [scientific consensus](https://skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-cook-et-al-2013.html) on human responsibility for climate change. Today it stands at [99.94%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change#/media/File:The_Consensus_on_Anthropogenic_Global_Warming,_2017.jpg). While interested people (e.g. [experts](https://www.scientists4future.org/) a and [school kids](https://www.fridaysforfuture.org)) quickly find out, most people still rest with a vague picture somewhere between "it's probably bad" and "we're already doing a lot". People with less media access or literacy often question what's coming altogether.

The majority lacks information that's vital for our survival. There's little understanding of the big picture beyond "it's bad". It took me quite a few hours, but it's possible to find and understand how bad it is. But we're leaving behind the majority. Also there's the well-studied sabotage of the debate.

### Let's make the problem easy to understand!
[Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/the-emergency/) does a good job at explaining [how bad it is](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/the-emergency/). It's more to the point and clear than most alternatives we can still do better:

* Let's collaborate on a simple website that shows (scientifically sound) why the climate crisis is such a big threat to our civilization.
* Let's make it easy to digest in 3 minutes.
* Let's pay for online marketing to make it visible to users worldwide.
* A simple tool to crowd-source this effort is this [Survey](survey).

### Challenge 2: How to join the fight?
Efficiency is the ratio between impact (slow down and stop climate change) and invested resources (your time and money). There's no simple way to find, assess and compare the efficiency of initiatives. That makes it harder for people to get engaged in an efficient way. Therefore a lot of energy put against the climate crisis is wasted.

### Let's collect and assess the efficiency of initiatives!
Success depends on our ability to quickly alter public opinion and policy. Many initiatives are doing great already (e.g. [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/), [ClientEarth](https://www.clientearth.org/), and [Fridays for Future](https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/)).

We can't precisely calculate an initiative's impact on stopping the climate crisis. But we can collect data to make it easier for individuals and investors to get involved: Number of people reached, media coverage, law changes, growth of contributors, appeal to a variety of demographics, internationality. These are only first ideas, for sure there's better ones out there.

* Let's work together to compile and assess initiatives fighting the climate crisis.
* Let's improve the assessment criteria over time to get better over time.
* Let's make all research and communication public as open source.
* Let's allow contributing in small chunks to make crowd-sourcing easy and fun. Everybody can do that: Kids after school, parents staying home with their children, stressed-out managers, shift workers, many more.

### Challenge 3: Experience, Efficiency and Focus
The private sector has been draining top talent from NGOs and the public sector for years. Many smart people have always been fighting for a better world. To stop the climate crisis, we need everybody.

### Let's create an environment that fosters exponential growth!
We have little time and lots of work to do. Whatever our efforts are, it's crucial that they scale exponentially:

* Initiatives have to be self-accelerating and contagious.
* Smart people experienced with managing rapid change and hyper-growth must get involved.

## Putting everything together

* Let's [collect, assess and present initiatives](initiatives) pushing political change!
* Let's reach out and help them with our skills, experience and networks!
* Let's convince our employers to let teams support the fight a few hours per week! Who'd leave a company that saves the world?
