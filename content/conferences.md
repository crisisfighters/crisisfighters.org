This page contains all conferences with a global perspective on the climate crisis and how to mitigate it.

# 1. Highly Recommendable Conferences
Unfortunately there is no conference yet that connects the global movement to fight the climate crisis. Having this and having it lead by the civil society instead of governments would be a powerful platform to connect, learn and empower the movement. That's why establishing such a conference made it on our list of [Ideas](/ideas).



# 2. Interesting Conferences

### [Climate Leadership Conference](https://climateleadershipconference.org/) (Detroit, USA)
Aimed at connecting people from businesses, governments and other organizations, talks at this conference look into how to deal with the climate crisis. There is high corporate attendance and questions of fundamental change in our economic system and society seem to be underrepresented.

ðŸ—“ The next date is March 4, 2020.


### [United Nations Climate Change Conference](https://www.ukcop26.org/) (Glasgow, UK)
Yearly conferences as formal meetings of the UNFCCC parties to assess progress in dealing with the climate crisis and establish legally binding obligations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. There is no access for private individuals.

ðŸ—“ The next date is November 9, 2020.


### [re:publica](https://re-publica.com) (Berlin, Germany)
Renowned conference with interesting talks on media, digital tehcnology and its impact on societies and politics. Great for networking and a political take on technology. Not specifically focused on the climate crisis.

ðŸ—“ The next date is May 6, 2020.


### [International Conference on Global Warming & Climate Change](https://climatechangeconference.co/) (Bangkok, Thailand)
Organized by TRIOGM (Sri Lanka) together with the University of Chittagong, Bangladesh and 
the University of Agriculture Peshawar Pakistan. As of February '20 the scientific commitee has only one member. The website overall doesn't look like this is a key conference.

ðŸ—“ The next date is September 10, 2020.


### [International Conference on Climate Change](https://climatechangeconferences.com/) (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)
This conference has only seven speakers. They seem to have academic backgrounds. We're not sure if this conference is relevant.

ðŸ—“ The next date is February 27, 2020.


# 3. Discouraged Conferences

### [International Conference on Climate Change](https://climateconference.heartland.org) (Las Vegas, USA)
* This is a most likely fossil industry funded (organized by the Heartland Institute) conference for climate deniers where paid scientist propagate lies.
* The right-wing Heartland Institute influences governments and society in the US and Europe. Years ago it fought hard to divert public attention from the dangers of smoking and keep big tobacco in business.

ðŸ—“ The next date is May 7, 2020.


### [World Conference on Climate Change](https://climatechange.insightconferences.com) (Zurich, Switzerland)
* There's no information about speakers, organized by a company organizing more than 3000 events, including more than 1000 conferences.
* Reason enough for us to question its political and scientific relevance.

### [World Summit on Climate Change and Global Warming](https://climate.euroscicon.com) (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
* There are no speakers with strong scientific credentials, organized by a company organizing dozens of unrelated conferences. 
* Reason enough for us to question its political and scientific relevance.

### [Various conferences organized by waset.org](https://waset.org/climate-change-conferences)
* The website contains auto-generated, exactly identical pages for every single of these conferences. There are submissions for each one but the question remains how much they're about improving CVs as opposed to presenting genuine science.
* If you know more, please share, we might be wrong.
