# Bogus and Discouraged Conferences

### [International Conference on Climate Change](https://climateconference.heartland.org) (Las Vegas, USA)
This is a fossil fuel funded (funneled and organized by the Heartland Institute) conference for climate deniers where paid scientist propagate lies.

The right-wing Heartland Institute tries to institute governments and society in the US and Europe. Years ago it fought hard to divert public attention from the dangers of smoking and keep big tobacco in business.

### [World Conference on Climate Change](https://climatechange.insightconferences.com) (Zurich, Switzerland)
There's no information about speakers, organized by a company organizing more than 3000 events, including more than 1000 conferences.

Reason enough for us to question its political and scientific relevance.

### [World Summit on Climate Change and Global Warming](https://climate.euroscicon.com) (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
There are no speakers with strong scientific credentials, organized by a company organizing dozens of unrelated conferences. 

Reason enough for us to question its political and scientific relevance.

### Various conferences organized by waset.org](https://waset.org/climate-change-conferences)
The website contains auto-generated, exactly identical pages for every single of these conferences. There are submissions for each one but the question remains how much they're about improving CVs as opposed to presenting genuine science.

If you know more, please share, we might be wrong.
