# Bogus and Discouraged Conferences

| Name        | Location           | Why Not?  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 14th International Conference on Climate Change | Las Vegas, USA | This is a fossil fuel funded (funneled and organized by the Heartland Institute) conference for climate deniers where paid scientist propagate lies. The right-wing Heartland Institute tries to institute governments and society in the US and Europe. Years ago it fought hard to divert public attention from the dangers of smoking and keep big tobacco in business. |
| World Conference on Climate Change      | Zurich, Switzerland | No information about speakers, organized by a company organizing more than 3000 events, including more than 1000 conferences. Relevance is doubtful. |
| World Summit on Climate Change and Global Warming      | Amsterdam, Netherlands      | No speakers with strong scientific credentials, organized by a company organizing dozens of unrelated conferences. Relevance is doubtful. |
| Various conferences organized by waset.org | are neat      |    $1 |
