How can you easily get a scientifically sound overview on the climate crisis? This page tries to answer that question while trying hard to keep the list as short as possible.

# Must Read Articles
To understand the climate crisis and where we are today, it’s worth understanding the timeline, the impact, where we are today and where we’ll most likely end up in a few decades. These articles and books do an extraordinary job at this. We selected them from many hundreds of texts about the crisis and suggest reading them in the given order.

> These texts are thoroughly researched (some come with extensive footnotes), renowned and frequently quoted.

It will come as an agonizing revelation to many readers to understand how thoroughly the problem was grasped and how the crisis was almost avoided in the 70s and 80s. An insightful story of how hard it can be to make long term challenges politically relevant.

Academic and popular science author Jared Diamond reviews the causes of historical instances of societal collapse — and what coping strategies failed or turned out successful. Diamond also explains that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.

### [The End of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Nature), by Bill McKibben

The first book on climate change addressed at a wider audience. The author offers two paths forward: "The Defiant Reflex" or a "more humble" way of living.

True nature, which was independent of human influence, has been replaced by an artificial nature in whose processes human beings play a part.

This concept may not seem frightening but McKibben points out that the changes we have made, and are continuing to make, in the chemistry of our atmosphere are unlike anything experienced before. We cannot escape them by fleeing to the woods. We have progressed beyond removing parts of the earth from the domain of true nature -- through farming, mining, construction -- to actually altering the global processes that define our environment.
