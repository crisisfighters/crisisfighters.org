# Crowd-sourcing to collect convincing facts

To act rationally, a society must understand the gravity of a threat, even if it's abstract and complex ([read more](about)).

* This survey presents you with facts that make the climate crisis tangible.
* With crowd-sourcing we can determine what's most convincing, easy to understand and able to trigger action.

Extinction rebellion did a great job at collecting [facts about the climate emergency](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/the-emergency/) in a similar manner, some can be found in our survey.

## How can I help?
1. [Take the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdL1DjIJ_4j4xsrA4iigE7z1Tcd9hazOVFnCTycAuQoLpmRaA/viewform)
2. Share the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdL1DjIJ_4j4xsrA4iigE7z1Tcd9hazOVFnCTycAuQoLpmRaA/viewform) with friends and contacts!
3. [Suggest changes](mailto:survey@reasn.de) (e.g. new facts or improvements). You can get an overview of all facts in the [corresponding sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16UcYOsweT1B-35Ael-9zmczslDZYcX7agBU0IgR3Bng)!
