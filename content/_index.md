This website wants to collaboratively collect and assess initiatives fighting extinction.
That is the breakdown of civilization due to the unmitigated climate and biodiversity crises.
We sympathize but are not affiliated with extinction rebellion.
Motivation and Background

# What's necessary

Calls to change individual behavior distract from what’s necessary. Our planet will become largely uninhabitable unless we quickly move the political mainstream to enforcing immediate, impactful action. 

## How bad is it?
Few people have time to do deep research about the climate crisis. There are facts that convince people to act. We want to find them using crowd-sourcing.

## Brave people are fighting extinction. Let’s help them.
We’re using the power of the crowd to compile and assess initiatives that are fighting the climate crisis. Want to help? This will show you where to invest your energy.
