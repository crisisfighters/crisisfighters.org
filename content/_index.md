We collaboratively collect and assess initiatives fighting the crisis of our climate and natural world.

# It's bad.

* Vertebrates die out 114x faster than normal. Insects might be mostly extinct by 2100.

* Every decade since the 80s is the hottest on record.

* With currently implemented policies, the planet will heat by 4C until the end of the century.

* The crisis self-accelerates ("Tipping Points")

We’re using the power of the crowd to compile and assess initiatives that are fighting the climate crisis. Want to help? This will show you where to invest your energy.
