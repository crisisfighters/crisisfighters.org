Hello!

The emergency (breakdown of climate and natural world) [threatens our civilization](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/the-emergency).

* Every decade since the 80s has been the hottest on record.
* Vertebrates die out 114x faster than normal.
* With today's policies, the planet will heat by more than 4C until 2100 and _much more beyond_.

Hundreds of initiatives worldwide are fighting hard to keep the crisis from getting worse.
We help you find out how you can contribute the most efficiently.
Everything you see here is crowdsourced and you can change it yourself!


Unless we drastically reduce emissions soon, large parts of Earth will become uninhabitable and civilization as we know it will break down before 2200.

# It won't end well...

... but even if it's to late to avoid devastating damage to earth and our children (which will take many decades to become visible), we can still fight to stop the crisis before it kills our future.
