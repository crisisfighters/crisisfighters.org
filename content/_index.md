Hi!

The breakdown of our climate and natural world (pollution, extinction, habitat loss) threatens our civilization.

Hundreds of initiatives worldwide are fighting hard to keep the crisis from getting worse.
This website attempts to collect relevant information for people who want to join the fight.
Everything you see here is crowdsourced and you can change it yourself!

* Every decade since the 80s has been the hottest on record.

* Vertebrates die out 114x faster than normal.

* With today's policies, the planet will heat by more than 4C until 2100 and _much more beyond_.

Unless we drastically reduce emissions soon, large parts of Earth will become uninhabitable and civilization as we know it will break down before 2200.

# This won't end well...

... but even if it's to late to avoid devastating damage to earth and our children (which will take many decades to become visible), we can still fight to stop the crisis before it kills our future.
