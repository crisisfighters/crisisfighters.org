> A mobile web app that allows offsetting flights and tipping initiatives

A mobile webapp that allows users of modern smartphones to pay for tree planting initiatives that offset their flights’ CO2e emissions.
It uses the web payments API to allow payments in 3 clicks (no credit card data needs to be entered)
Should provide a MyTaxi/FreeNow like interface to send a 10%, 15% or 20% tip to Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion (more initiatives to follow)
Can be used by FFF activists on airports to give out buttons to travellers using it (turning flight shaming into something constructive)
You can move this forward by helping with the implementation, Stripe and setting up a legal entity
Technical implementation is trivial
It’s not clear yet whether this requires a lot of book-keeping or if it can be set up without a legal entity. Please reach out if you know more!
