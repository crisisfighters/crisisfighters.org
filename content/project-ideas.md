In addition to the great [initiatives](initiatives) that are alread out there, we want to collect inspiring ideas. [Reach out](mailto:ideas@reasn.de) to add more.

## flyGood.io
> A mobile web app that allows offsetting flights and tipping initiatives

[Climnate Stewards](https://www.climatestewards.org/offset) and [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/impact-quantification/gold-standard-global-goals) do an excellent job at providing a scrutinized, transparent way of setting of the emissions generated by each flight. This project aims at providing an easier-to-use website to channel money to them while also allowing to "tip" organizations that actively fight to stop the climate crisis.

flyGood.io will be a mobile webapp that allows users of modern smartphones to pay for tree planting initiatives that offset their flights’ CO2e emissions.

* It uses the web payments API to allow payments in 3 clicks (no credit card data needs to be entered)
* Should provide a MyTaxi/FreeNow like interface to send a 10%, 15% or 20% tip to Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion (more initiatives to follow)
* Can be used by FFF activists on airports to give out buttons to travellers using it (turning flight shaming into something constructive)


### You can move this forward by helping with the implementation, Stripe and setting up a legal entity
* Technical implementation is trivial
* It’s not clear yet whether this requires a lot of book-keeping or if it can be set up without a legal entity. Please reach out if you know more!
