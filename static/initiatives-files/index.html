<h1>Crisis Fighters</h1>
<p>
    This website wants to collaboratively collect and assess initiatives fighting extinction.<br/>
    That is the breakdown of civilization due to the unmitigated climate and biodiversity crises.<br/>
    We sympathize but are not affiliated with <a href="https://rebellion.earth/">extinction rebellion</a>.</p>

<h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
<p>Calls to change individual behavior distract from what‚Äôs necessary. Our planet will become largely uninhabitable
    unless we quickly move the political mainstream to enforcing immediate, impactful action. Assessing the efficiency
    of existing and new initiatives in a crowd-sourced, data-driven way allows to efficiently funnel resources (time &
    money) to give us a fighting chance. <a href="https://medium.com/@alexthiel/stop-climate-change-ea99133daac5">More
