# Crisis Fighters - Initiatives
We want to collaboratively collect and assess initiatives fighting the crisis of our climate and our natural world. That is the breakdown of civilization due to the unmitigated climate and biodiversity crises.<br/>
    We sympathize but are not affiliated with <a href="https://rebellion.earth/">extinction rebellion</a>.</p>
