# CrisisFighters.org
At [CrisisFighters.org](https://www.CrisisFighters.org) we collect all initatives that fight the climate emergency. For each one we collect additional data to allow you to find out how you can contribute to saving the world.

In addition we collect must read's and our own perspective on how we can stop the crisis.

> üìù We're open-source so please contribute to add more content and improve what's already there!

> üìà Please learn more about the emergency. Our [must reads section](https://www.crisisfighters.org/must-read/) is a good start as is XR's [The Emergency](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/the-emergency/).

## Contribute to Texts and Content

Everybody can update the content on CrisisFighters.org. To make that possible, we use a technology called [Git](https://git-scm.com). It allows us to keep track of every little change anybody ever did on the website. Also, because everything is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/crisisfighters/crisisfighters.org), every change can (but doesn't have to be) scrutinized and discussed. Again, all that information ist stored forever and publicly available.
